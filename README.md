Please note that I cannot supply the lyrics themselves. They are stored in the dataframe which is saved in `lyrics-df-ver2.Rds`. One row in this dataframe is a line (column 'line'). Additional columns are the line number ('line_no'), the final word in the line ('last_word'), how many words there are in the line ('n_words'), the artist ('artist'), the file where the line comes from ('file') and a logical column 'last_line_in_file'.
